After Jus Soli: Systems Collapse and the Rise of Apartheid Authoritarianism (Excerpt)

Ph.D. Student, Systems Science & Industrial Engineering, SUNY Binghamton

Introduction: From Warning to Reality
The revocation of jus soli‚Äîbirthright citizenship‚Äîwas not an isolated flourish of executive overreach. It was the first tripwire detonated in a larger campaign of institutional demolition. Now, with the release of a draft executive order obtained by The New York Times (Edward Wong, April 20, 2025), the scale of this transformation is unmistakable [Wong, 2025]. The Trump administration intends to restructure the U.S. State Department into a racially segregated, ideologically loyal organ of centralized executive control.

The proposed shutdown of Africa operations, human rights offices, refugee policy infrastructure, and minority fellowships is not bureaucratic optimization‚Äîit is a targeted systems breach. It marks the collapse of feedback loops, ethical buffering, and the multichannel architecture required to keep democratic institutions adaptive and antifragile.

The Executive Order as Systems Attack
The 16-page draft order proposes:

Elimination of the Bureau of African Affairs

Closure of all "nonessential" embassies and consulates in sub-Saharan Africa

Termination of the Rangel and Pickering Fellowships and their Howard University pipeline

Shutdown of the State Department‚Äôs human rights, climate, refugee, and democracy offices

Replacement of regional bureaus with four consolidated "corps"‚ÄîAfrica omitted entirely

This is a radical re-engineering of U.S. foreign policy as a racialized tool of power. It mirrors apartheid-era architectures: consolidating control, eliminating multicultural engagement, and filtering institutional access by ideology and identity.

Complex Systems Analysis: Collapse in Progress
Drawing from Donella Meadows‚Äôs ‚ÄúLeverage Points‚Äù (1999), the most dangerous changes in a system come not from parameter tweaks, but from the elimination of feedback loops, buffers, and institutional purpose. According to Bar-Yam‚Äôs multiscale complexity framework, system resilience depends on distributed nodes, overlapping jurisdictions, and multiscale adaptation. This reorganization cuts all redundancy from the State Department.

We introduce a new set of resilience degradation metrics:

RNL: Redundancy Node Loss

FLI: Feedback Latency Increase

TER: Trust Erosion Rate

ETI: Ethnographic Targeting Index

These will be used to extend our agent-based simulation of democratic collapse.
