Subject: Final Systems Analysis on Birthright Citizenship and State Dept Reorg (Botelho, 2025)

Dear [Recipient Name],

I'm writing to share the final version of my systems-science analysis of recent efforts to revoke birthright citizenship and dismantle democratic redundancy within U.S. institutions. This study integrates agent-based modeling (NetLogo + Python), resilience metrics, and simulation graphs that demonstrate a projected 38% decline in civic survivability when redundancy and trust decay are coupled.

This is both a scientific and civic warning. I'd greatly value your feedback and am open to collaboration or citation for any upcoming research or editorials.

Warm regards,
